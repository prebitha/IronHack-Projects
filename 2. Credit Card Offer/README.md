This Project was completed during the mid week of the bootcamp.

## OJECTIVE:

We have a credit card dataset and we used Machine Learnings Binary Classification to find if their customers accepted the offer - yes/no

## DEFINING OUR GOALS:

- [X] Quered the data in SQL using MySql Workbench
- [X] Coded in python in Jupyter Notebook:
     - [X] we used three Machine learning Models . 
          - [X] Logistic Regression
          - [X] Randomn Forest Regressiom
          - [X] Gaussian NB 
     - [X] The dataset is highly imbalanced.
          - [X] imbalanced was dealt using SMOTE
     - [X] Wrangled the Quarterly Balances 
          - [X] added two more columns, differences of the quarters.
     - [X] Dropped columns
          - [X] Average Balances

## VISUALISATION OF THE DATA :
The visualisation of the data was done using tableau and you can see it ![here](https://public.tableau.com/profile/prebitha.staphney.abraham#!/vizhome/Data-Mid-Bootcamp-Project-Classification2_16207571376970/0?publish=yes)
